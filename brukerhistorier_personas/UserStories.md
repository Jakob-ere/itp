### User Story 1

Tom is a person who owns cryptovaluta in several exchanges. He is tired of having to log in to all the different exchanges in order to get an overview of how his investments are going. He wants to be able to gather everything in one place. He feels it would be easier if he could _buy_ coins on a seperate exchange and from there keep track of all his investments.

### User Story 2

He wants the application to have some privacy. This is so that if someone is on his device, they won't be able to se what he is invested in. Although nobody would be able use his assets he still feels more comfortable if all his investments are hidden behind username / password protection.

### User Story 3

Tom also likes statistics and therefore he wants to get some extra information about his investments. There are many different indicators/ stats for every coin, and he wants to be able to switch between simple stats and a more specific information. Therefore he wants an application where he can switch between pro mode and normal mode. In pro mode he wants to get more information about each coin. This is for him to make a decision about what to buy. In normal mode he only wants a few basic stats, so he can quickly se how each coin is doing.
