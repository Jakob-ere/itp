The CryptoCojo app is designed for users that owns crypto in different platforms. It gives the user the ability to "Buy Coins" and keep track on how it's going. The main purpose off this app is that you can easily get an overview even if you own coins on different platforms.
This app does not use real money therefore it will be like a fantasy-app, where you buy coins with fake money and get an overview.
