## 0.1 release 21.09.22

In the first release of the application CryptoCojo, the focus has been on getting the basic
functionality going. 

- The project is built with maven.
- The project is also working on gitpod.
- An easy GUI that lets you make a user and log in with the same user. There you can see
some general information about the user. 
- Logic for saving and retrieving user information to and from a file. We use the Gson-library 
to serialize/deserialize user information to and from a .json file. 
- A login system is made where you can make a user, log in, and log out.
- Scene-switching logic is made so we can now switch from different scenes in the same GUI.
- Logic for getting data from the coincap.io crypto-API is made. Our plan for the future is to get data history on different coins. With the history, we can make graphs in the GUI.
- Tests for user and API are made.

The different classes that are made in this first release are not going to change, at least not much. The main change is that we are going to extend the different classes wich needs more functionality.
